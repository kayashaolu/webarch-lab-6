# Lab 6
Create your first web server

## In this lab you will accomplish the following:
 - Create your own web server without any starter code
 - Move static HTML/CSS/JS code to a web server
 
## Move the website you created in [lab 4](https://github.com/kayashaolu/webarch-lab-4) to its own server
 - It should have the same functionality as lab 4
 - Must use a template (think ```res.render()```)
 - Must create a static server to host your css and js files
 - The end goal is to have the same page you had in lab 4 running from your own server "http://localhost:3000/"
